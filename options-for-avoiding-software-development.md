One of the biggest takeaways from the class for me was that internal software development should be avoided when just starting out, such as when cash constrained, testing a concept, or creating a minimally viable product. [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) and [Squarespace](https://www.shopify.com/) are great for building websites, and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) works well if you're trying to do e-commerce. Similarly for building mobile apps there's [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/). For a flat monthly/yearly fee you can get a fairly professional and customized looking product, and not have to manage any of the software development or support yourself.

Here's an example of an e-commerce site made with Shopify:
