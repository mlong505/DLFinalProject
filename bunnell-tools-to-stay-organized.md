During our last class, we discussed ways to keep organized when working with a team through the development process. Professor Bell highlighted two tools in particular, which I found really useful:

-	Github: The interface and collaboration features make it easy to work with others while maintaining a lot of requirements, required changes and completed work. Prior to CBS, I worked on large ERP consulting projects and we often used manual tools to track development. Something like Github would have been incredibly helpful in managing the team and keeping people on track
-	Trello: Trello helps teams organize projects by moving tasks across a series of cards. It minimizes the amount of work in progress because team members can see what others are working on. While interning at Nordstrom this summer, we used kanban boards during our Monday morning stand ups, where we placed post-it notes across the board to highlight our weekly priorities. I definitely saw the value of this process and plan to use Trello to manage my own tasks moving forward.

Both of these tools bring value beyond the development space. They create platforms to stay organized, which is incredibly important to maintaining an efficient process.
