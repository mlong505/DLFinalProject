<b>Evan's Digital Literacy Course Takeaway:
Build. Measure. Learn.</b>

First, let's begin with some good old fashioned graphic representation (I have heard most MBA students learn better with pictures):

One of the most important takeaways that I had with respect to the Digital Literacy course taught by Peter Bell was that frequent iterations and cycling through the Build-Measure-Learn loop is an important and effective way to really improve a product or service offering. 

The idea of Build-Measure-Learn cycles and how more iterations can drive meaningful product improvement is something that I think resonates with my own success philosophy, which is that success is perpetuated by continuous incremental improvements over a period of time. Both success and failure feedback that is garnered through the Build-Measure-Learn cycle can help drive incremental and compound improvements over time as well as help uncover best practices. 

In summary: Repetition is key â€“ even in the digital world!

For more information, I have found an excellent Steve Blank article that provides a good summary of the Build-Measure-Learn cycle here:
