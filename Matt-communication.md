##Communicating with developers
1. **Communicate both narrow specifications and broader goals:** While you should give your developers specifications for the project that they are working on, you should also talk to them about your overall intent (i.e. “command intent”). This will allow them the independence to find creative ways to accomplish project goals.
2. **Discuss realistic goals for working at a sustainable pace**: Work with your developers to create realistic milestones. They will be able to judge the amount of time that it takes to accomplish tasks. You should make sure that they can work at a sustainable pace that will not burn them out over time.
3. **Ask developers about what they find thematically or technically interesting**: Developers are likely to be motivated by the opportunity to work on projects that allow them to work using interesting languages/frameworks and to develop their skills. They may also want to focus on a topic that is of personal interest to them.  
4. **Create clear standards for evaluating work outputs**: Set out clear standards for how you will evaluate working releases. For example: “The link to the about page will work, and the drop-down menu on the about page will be working.”

I found an interview with David Heinemeier Hansson about managing developers remotely:

An additional resource is the book mentioned in class, *Drive* by Daniel Pink:
