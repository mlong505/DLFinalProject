I found the session on advertising sales very informative. While I knew that ads were a tremendous source of revenue, I lacked an appreciation for how they were bought / sold or how their positioning within different content was decided. It was interesting to discover that one of Google’s biggest obstacles was determining how to attract ads from conglomerates, such as Coca Cola, who don’t use Google to advertise online as they need to reach a mass audience at any one time, which is not something that Google’s platform allows for at the moment.  I found this short article / graphic (http://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords) really helpful in explaining the ecosystem.

In addition, I recently discovered that the process of bidding for ads lacks transparency while requiring significant infrastructure.  We had this start-up come present at one of my other classes (http://www.beeswax.com/) whose mission is to “offer the first "bidder as a service" solution, allowing brand marketers, agencies, or ad networks the ability to operate their own cloud-based bidder — a technology that automatically bids on the real-time auctions that take place to buy ad space as a web page loads. The service does away with the cost and time investment it takes to build one from scratch.”
